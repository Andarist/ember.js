/**
  The `{{on}}` modifier lets you easily add event listeners (it uses
  [EventTarget.addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
  internally).

  For example, if you'd like to run a function on your component when a `<button>`
  in the components template is clicked you might do something like:

  ```app/components/like-post.hbs
  <button {{on 'click' this.saveLike}}>Like this post!</button>
  ```

  ```app/components/like-post.js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { action } from '@ember/object';

  export default class LikePostComponent extends Component {
    @action
    saveLike() {
      // someone likes your post!
      // better send a request off to your server...
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Arguments

  `{{on}}` accepts two positional arguments, and a few named arguments.

  The positional arguments are:

  - `event` -- the name to use when calling `addEventListener`
  - `callback` -- the function to be passed to `addEventListener`

  The named arguments are:

  - capture -- a `true` value indicates that events of this type will be dispatched
    to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it
    in the DOM tree.
  - once -- indicates that the listener should be invoked at most once after being
    added. If true, the listener would be automatically removed when invoked.
  - passive -- if `true`, indicates that the function specified by listener will never
    call preventDefault(). If a passive listener does call preventDefault(), the user
    agent will do nothing other than generate a console warning. See
    [Improving scrolling performance with passive listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Improving_scrolling_performance_with_passive_listeners)
    to learn more.

  The callback function passed to `{{on}}` will receive any arguments that are passed
  to the event handler. Most commonly this would be the `event` itself.

  If you would like to pass additional arguments to the function you should use
  the `{{fn}}` helper.

  For example, in our example case above if you'd like to pass in the post that
  was being liked when the button is clicked you could do something like:

  ```app/components/like-post.hbs
  <button {{on 'click' (fn this.saveLike @post)}}>Like this post!</button>
  ```

  In this case, the `saveLike` function will receive two arguments: the click event
  and the value of `@post`.

  ### Function Context

  In the example above, we used `@action` to ensure that `likePost` is
  properly bound to the `items-list`, but let's explore what happens if we
  left out `@action`:

  ```app/components/like-post.js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class LikePostComponent extends Component {
    saveLike() {
      // ...snip...
    }
  }
  ```

  In this example, when the button is clicked `saveLike` will be invoked,
  it will **not** have access to the component instance. In other
  words, it will have no `this` context, so please make sure your functions
  are bound (via `@action` or other means) before passing into `on`!
